        pyramids</a><span class="bodycopy"> design is evident from the figures. 
        Without it the dimensions are liot quite<br>
        complete, for if it were removed, the area of the Pyramid's side would 
        be<br>
        99999'99 square cubits only. With the 5 cubic inches of gold pyramidion 
        in<br>
        place, the figure of 100,000 square cubits represents the total area.<br>
        As the dimensions of the Great Pyramid are multiplied by the ratios of<br>
        the ancient number canon they expand to frame the dimensions of this earth,<br>
        and it is possible that they could have been taken further to represent 
        the<br>
        dimensions of the grand orb (the circle described by the<br>
        earth's path round the sun), planetary-intervals and the measurements.<br>
        of time. Going the other way, into the microcosm, these same Pyramid<br>
        measures contract proportionally through a series of pyramidions at the<br>
        apex, shrinking from miles to inches, to mere specks and finally into 
        the<br>
        world of the atom. The symbolism is of a seed, planted at the apex of 
        the<br>
        Pyramid, programmed with all the numbers and ratios for its potential<br>
        growth. It is like that, smallest of all seeds, spoken of in the New<br>
        Testament, the 'grain of mustard', which grows up into the Tree of Life<br>
        encQmpassing the whole universe.</span></p>
      <p><span class="bodycopy"> <a name="ancient-egyptian-pyramids" id="ancient-egyptian-pyramids"></a>The 
        numerical patterns in the Pyramid's dimensions imply that the<br>
        capstone consisted of a succession of diminishing pyrami9ions, each forming<br>
        the tip of the one below it, with the small gold pyramid, 5 cubic inches 
        in<br>
        volume, at the apex. Yet if the gold model is to represent the whole<br>
        structure in miniature, it must itself have a separate tip. This tiny<br>
        object, set in gold, could only have been some form of crystal. Esoteric<br>
        traditions about the use of crystals in the ancient world for attracting 
        and<br>
        transmitting cosmic energies are echoed by modern seers, such as the<br>
        well-known 'Sleeping Prophet' of America, Edgar Cayce, who described visions<br>
        of the Atlantean crystal technology which empowered the last world<br>
        civilization and finally, by its abuse, brought about the cataclysm.<br>
        An illustration of how the small, golden, crystal-topped pyramidion could<br>
        have been held in place, together with the other layers making up the<br>
        capstone, is given by a strange hieroglyph which shows a truncated pyramid<br>
        topped by a staff or gnomon&quot; </span> </p>

        organised in Cairo for<br>
        Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni and the French composer Jean Michel Jarre.<br>
        The latter has been an international household name since the 1970s due 
        to<br>
        the enormous success of his electronic high-tech music compositions<br>
        'Oxygene' and 'Equinox'. Jean Michel Jarre is also an ambassador for UNESCO<br>
        and has, since the 1980s, been organising extravaganzas of laser lights 
        and<br>
        music for historical events. One of these was for the bicentennial of 
        the<br>
        French Revolution in 1989, where more than two million spectators gathered<br>
        in the Champs-Elysees in Paris, from the Place de la Concorde all the 
        way to<br>
