      <P>All who study the cabalistic science and the geo-metry and numbers of 
        creation are attacked by melancholy, some-times fatally, the suicide rate 
        among cabalists being notoriously high. The Point is clearly made in Durer's 
        Melancholia. The garden of paradise,symbol of the ultimate perfection 
        of human consciousness, has many delightful inhabitants which are at the 
        same time dange-rous beasts to whoever fails to recognise their nature 
        and function; and of these the most treachorous is the mercurial old serpent 
        of wisdom, that leads men on in the search of the treasure of which it 
        is in itself the the venomous custodian.</P>

      <P>T<I>he Zed Aliz Zed again presents credentials</I></P>
      <P>This acknowledgement of the contributions of others within this hymn 
        of praise to creative consciousness is freely and humbly given. It is 
        perhaps indicative of where Eht Namuh stands on the ladder of its progress 
        in this quintessential moment of time, that each and every one of us seeks 
        a credit for this of that which all of us, as creative entities have been 
        entrusted with exteriorizing. For and on behalf of that creative intelligent 
        consciousness, holding each and every one of us in thrall, the initiator, 
        and motivating power of the mysterious process of life.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Eht Namuh within the this of the that of the he as in she of the 
        thou, of the thou as in ought, of the ought as in thought, give only praise 
        and credit to the true creator. The energy of intelligent living creativity 
        abundant and fecund manifested everywhere and in everything, for all is 
        living energy, living creative energy, known variously and collectively 
        as the one God. Cast off the shackles of thy puny ego Eht Namuh and accord 
        thanks only for thy honoured participation in creativity of a kind and 
        thank your stars for that, for there is a mountain to climb or otherwise 
        a mounting oblivion shall be your future. In the beginning was the word 
        and the word was that notion, the notion of an individual unique self 
        is no notion at all, therefore if any part of the this of the that of 
        this work can in any way help to free the understanding of thee Eht Namuh 
        from the dark age tyranny of thy thinking thoughts of the he as in she 
        absurdity of the no notion at all of an individual self publish and be 
        not damned, but be thou blessed. Give only thy praise in wonder to that 
        living essence of the energy within and without which is thy true nature. 
        Blessed be the name of thy true god which is at one with thee, for thou 
        art of it and it of thee.</P>

      <P>"This man had said to that man: Give me thy daughter to wife, and the 
        other man had answered: What wilt thou give for her? And the other man 
        had had nothing. Then the above mentioned man had said: Seeing that thou 
        canst pay no dowry nor any presents to hang at the bride's girdle at the 
        betrothal, thou shalt serve me for as many years as the week hath days."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"Then said the other man: So be it. In the name of the king, so 
        be it. Each side took one of the contracts."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"The agreement was sensible, the judge found it fair, and from 
        the business side, Jacob himself had not much to complain of. If he owed 
        his uncle a mina of silver at <B>sixty</B> shekels, <B>seven</B> years' 
        labour would not suffice to pay the debt, for the average wage for a labourer 
        was seven shekels a year, and seven of them would not make up the sum. 
        He felt profoundly that the economic point of view was a very deceptive 
        one; that if there were a just scale, a God's scale, as it were, the side 
        with the <B>seven</B> years would have made the side with the shekels 
        fly up into the air. But after all, he would spend these years in Rachel's 
        company and thus love's sacrifice would be mingled with much joy."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>Page 175</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"<B>Seven</B> years! <B>Seven</B> years they must wait for each 
        other."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"As for the<B> seven</B> years, they were even now in the process 
        of being lived down."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"Jacob suppressed the thought in his mind. This he did and so too 
        should the narrator, and not imagine that he can pass over and obliterate 
        the time with a little sentence like "<B>Seven</B> years went by." It 
        is the story-tellers way to say things like that."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"And even pass as though they had been <B>seven</B> days. For such 
        is the tradition: that the <B>seven</B> years before which Jacob had at 
        first quailed with fear, passed by like days."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"What we have here is certainly no "<B>seven-sleeper</B>" enchantment, 
        nor, indeed, any other kind, save that of time itself, whose larger units 
        pass as do the smaller ones, neither slow nor fast, but simply pass."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Page 176</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"Jacob did not say that <B>seven</B> years went as fast as days"</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"Thus it was Jacob said that <B>seven</B> years, to him, like days."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"<B>Seven</B> days may under some circumstances be harder to swallow, 
        a more daring adventure in time than <B>seven</B> years."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"And if we look back, lo, the point where we stepped in is "far 
        back" it is, for instance <B>seven</B> years away, years that have passed 
        like days."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"No one says that Jacob undertook and entered upon his <B>seven</B> 
        years with joy, for only after they had passed might he beget children 
        with Rachel."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"And thus <B>seven</B> years to him, while not so little as seven 
        years in the sight of God, were yet not nearly so much to him as to one 
        who should live but <B>fifty</B> or <B>sixty</B> years."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Page 176/7</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"Pure waiting is torture; no one could bear to sit <B>seven</B> 
        years, or <B>seven</B> days."</P>

      <P>&nbsp;"What would have become of us, for instance when Jacob was serving 
        with the Devil Laban, <B>seven </B>and <B>thirteen</B> and <B>five</B> 
        - in short, <B>twenty-five</B> years."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"And what would become of us now without that reasonable principle, 
        when our little bark, driven by the measuredly moving stream of narration, 
        hovers again on the brink of a time-cataract of <B>seven</B> and <B>seven</B> 
        prophesied years? Well, to begin with, and just amongst ourselves: in 
        these <I>fourteen</I> years things were neither quite so definitely good 
        nor so definitely bad as the prophecy would have them."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"For the sake of the prophecy they are willing to agree that <B>two</B> 
        and <B>two</B> make <B>five</B> - if the phrase may be used in a context 
        where not <B>five</B> but an even higher odd number, namely <B>seven</B>, 
        is in question. Probably this would constitute no great difficulty, five 
        being almost as respectable a number as <B>seven</B>; and surely no reasonable 
        man would insist that <B>five</B> instead of<B> seven</B> could constitute 
        and inexactitude. In fact and in reality the prophesied <B>seven</B> looked 
        rather more like <B>five</B>."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;"Among the <B>fat</B> ones were <B>one</B> or <B>two </B>which 
        might have been described as certainly not <B>lean</B>, but to a critical 
        eye as certainly no more than very moderately <B>fat</B>. The <B>lean</B>

      <CENTER>
        Subject, Where angels don't fear to tread. 
      </CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;"<B>Rachel, I responded to your last message, as I was supposed 
        to do before I opened it. Having now read it, I write as one who has been 
        blessed yet again by the thou of the them beyond our ken, reaching out 
        to this given soul touching, me within the hermitage of that aloneness 
        through which this entity is allowed right of passage to exteriorize the 
        words of others. For I am the journeyman, thou art the one who from out 
        of the kindness and fineness of a sisters spirit has conveyed to me a 
        message within a message. Today is the ninth of the eighth month. Nine 
        times eight is seventy-two. Seventy-two is the number of conspirators 
        that along with our brother Set consigned our beloved brother Osiris to 
        the other side. Beloved brother Set had beloved brother Osiris dismembered 
        into fourteen separate pieces. Fourteen times seventy two is one zero 
        zero eight. Re, our father in the age known as the first time spawned 
        eight gods. Eight and one are nine. Nine of eight, toady's date. We say 
        again nine times eight is seventy-two. The other man the God Thoth reigned 
        for three two two six years. Three times two, times two, times six is 
        seventy-two. Today via your source material you preached the blessed sanctity 
        of my aloneness and acted as a sacred conduit from the them of the thou, 
        of the ought as in thought. The Book of Revelations is the last piece 
        of the pattern of the jigsaw that is not a jigsaw. The eye of the me, 
        as in you, as in he, as in the she that is thee started to transcribe 
        this yesterday, read it wah Rachel. Note also the reference to the number 
        forty five contained within your message of a message. Finally dear Rachel, 
        seventy-two is the number of years required for the equinoctial sun to 
        complete a precessional shift of one degree along the ecliptic. My dear 
        you know the difference between the words exoteric and esoteric. That 
        of which you are now in receipt is at this quintessential moment of the 
        now, the now of yours and mine, fast coming to fruition. It's time draws 
        nigh, until the moment when its tick talks thy tongue should be held fast 
        between the sweetness of thy lips. I weep tears of gratitude for such 
        an act of considered kindness as has seen fit to reach out within the 
        oft times desperation of the aloneness that this task has visited upon 
        me. Blessings on thy frosty pow and that of thy source. God willing it 
        will not be too late. Love to thee Rachel. Goodbye my dear. Your loving 
        husband Jacob.</B></P>

      <P>"In some of the most powerful and enduring myths that we have inherited 
        from ancient times, our species seems to have retained a confused but 
        resonant memory of a terrifying global catastrophe.</P>
      <P>Where do these myths come from?</P>
      <P>Why, though they derive from unrelated cultures, are their storylines 
        so similar? why are they laden with common symbolism? and why do they 
        so often share the same stock characters and plots? If they are indeed 
        memories, why are there no historical records of the planetary disaster 
        they seem to refer to?</P>
      <P>Could it be that the myths themselves are historical records? Could it 
        be that these cunning and immortal stories, composed by anonymous geniuses, 
        were the medium used to record such information and pass it on in the 
        time before history began?</P>
      <P>And the ark went upon the face of the waters</P>
      <P>There was a king, in ancient Sumer, who sought eternal life. His name 
        was <B>Gilgamesh</B>. We know of his exploits because the myths and traditions 
        of Mesopotamia, inscribed in cuneiform script upon tablets of baked clay, 
        have survived. Many thousands of these tablets, some dating back to the 
        beginning of the third millennium BC, have been excavated from the sands 
        of modern Iraq. They transmit a unique picture of a vanished culture and 
        remind us that even in those days of <B>/ </B>Page&nbsp;202 / lofty antiquity 
        human beings preserved memories of times still more remote - times from 
        which they were separated by the interval of a great and terrible deluge:</P>
      <P>I will proclaim to the world the deeds of Gilgamesh. This was the man 
        to whom all things were known; this was the king who knew the countries 
        of the world. He was wise, he saw mysteries and knew secret things, he 
        brought us a tale of the days before the flood. He went on a long journey, 
        was weary, worn-out with labour, returning he rested, he engraved on a 
        stone the whole story.<FONT SIZE="-1">1</FONT></P>
      <P>The story that <B>Gilgamesh </B>brought back had been told to him by 
        a certain Utnapishtim, a king who had ruled thousands of years earlier, 
        who had survived the great flood, and who had been rewarded with the gift 
        of immortality because he had preserved the seeds of humanity and of all 
        living things.</P>
      <P>It was long, long ago, said <B>Utnapishtim</B>, when the gods dwelt on 
        earth: <B>Anu</B>, lord of the firmament, <B>Enlil</B>, the enforcer of 
        divine decisions, Ishtar, goddess of war and sexual love and <B>Ea</B>, 
        lord of the waters, man's natural friend and protector.</P>
      <P>In those days the world teemed, the people multiplied, the world bellowed 
        like a wild bull, and the great god was aroused by the</P>
      <P>clamour. Enlil heard the clamour and he said to the gods in council, 
        'The uproar of mankind is intolerable and sleep is no longer possible 
        by reason of the babel.' So the gods agreed to exterminate mankind.'<FONT SIZE="-1">2</FONT></P>
      <P>Ea, however, took pity on <B>Utnapishtim</B>. Speaking through the reed 
        i wall of the king's house he told him of the imminent catastrophe and 
        instructed him to build a boat in which he and his family could survive:</P>
      <P>Tear down your house and build a boat, abandon possessions and look for 
        life, despise wordly goods and save your soul. . . Tear down your house, 
        I say, and build a boat with her dimensions in proportion - her width 
        and length in harmony. Put aboard the seed of all living things, into 
        the boat.'</P>
      <P>In the nick of time <B>Utnapishtim</B> built the boat as ordered. 'I 
        loaded into her all that I had,' he said, 'loaded her with the seed of 
        all living things': / &nbsp;Page 203 / I put on board all my kith and 
        kin, put on board cattle, wild beasts from open country, all kinds of 
        craftsmen. . . The time was fulfilled. When the first light of dawn appeared 
        a black cloud came up from the base of the sky; it thundered within where 
        <B>Adad</B>, lord of the storm was riding. . . A stupor of despair went 
        up to heaven when the god of the storm turned daylight to darkness, when 
        he smashed the land like a cup...</P>
      <P>On the first day the tempest blew swiftly and brought the flood. . . 
        No man could see his fel1ow. Nor could the people be distinguished from 
        the sky. Even the gods were afraid of the flood. They withdrew; they went 
        up to the heaven of <B>Anu </B>and crouched in the outskirts. The gods 
        cowered like curs while <B>Ishtar</B> cried, shrieking aloud, 'Have I 
        given birth unto these mine own people only to glut with their bodiesthe 
        sea as though they were fish?'<FONT SIZE="-1">4</FONT></P>
      <P>Meanwhile, continued <B>Utnapishtim</B>:</P>
      <P>For <B>six</B> days and nights the wind blew, torrent and tempest and 
        flood overwhelmed the world, tempest and flood raged together like warring 
        hosts. When the <B>seventh</B> day dawned the storm from the south subsided, 
        the sea grew calm, the flood was stilled. I looked at the face of the 
        world and there was silence. The surface of the sea stretched as flat 
        as a roof-top. All mankind had returned to clay. . . I opened a hatch 
        and light fell on my face. Then I bowed low, I sat down and I wept, the 
        tears streamed down my face, for on every side was the waste' of water. 
        . . <B>Fourteen</B> leagues distant there appeared a mountain, and there 
        the boat grounded; on the mountain of Nisir the boat held fast, she held 
        fast and did not budge. . . When the <B>seventh</B> day dawned I loosed 
        a <B>dove</B> and let her go. She flew away, but finding no resting place 
        she returned. Then I loosed a swallow, and she flew away but finding no 
        resting place she returned. I loosed a <B>raven</B>, she saw that the 
        waters had retreated, she ate, she flew around, she cawed, and she did 
        not come back.'<FONT SIZE="-1">5</FONT></P>
      <P><B>Utnapishtim</B> knew that it was now safe to disembark:</P>
      <P>I poured out a libation on the mountain top. . . I heaped up wood and</P>
      <P>cane and cedar and myrtle. . . When the gods smel1ed the sweet</P>
      <P>savour they gathered like flies over the sacrifice. . .'<FONT SIZE="-1">6</FONT></P>
      <P>These texts are not by any means the only ones to come down to us from 
        the ancient land of <B>Sumer</B>. In other tablets - some almost 5000 
        / Page 204 / years old, others less than 3000 years old - the '<B>Noah</B> 
        figure' of <B>Utnapishtim </B>is known variously as <B>Zisudra,</B> <B>Xisuthros</B> 
        or <B>Atrahasis.</B> . . Even so, he is always instantly recognizable 
        as the same patriarchal character, forewarned by the same merciful god, 
        who rides out the same universal flood in the same storm-tossed ark and 
        whose descendants repopulate the world.</P>
      <P>There are many obvious resemblances between the Mesopotamian flood myth 
        and the famous biblical story of Noah and the deluge' (see note). Scholars 
        argue endlessly about the nature of these resem-blances.What really matters, 
        however, is that in each sphere of influence the same solemn tradition 
        has been preserved for posterity-</P>
      <P>a tradition which tells, in graphic language, of a global catastrophe 
        and of the near-total annihilation of mankind.</P>

      <P>"How far and how widely across the myth memories of mankind do the ripples 
        of the great flood spread?</P>
      <P>Very widely indeed. More than 500 deluge legends are known around the 
        world and, in a survey of <B>86</B> of these (<B>20</B> Asiatic, <B>3</B> 
        European, <B>7</B> African, <B>46</B> American and <B>10</B> from Australia 
        and the Pacific), the specialist researcher Dr Richard Andree concluded 
        that <B>62</B> were entirely independent of the Mesopotamian and Hebrew 
        accounts <B>25</B></P>
      <P>For example, early Jesuit scholars who were among the first Europeans 
        to visit China had the opportunity in the Imperial Library - to study 
        a vast work, consisting of <B>432</B>0 volumes, said to have been handed 
        down from ancient times and to contain 'all knowledge'. This great book 
        included a number 'of traditions which told of the consequences that followed 
        when mankind rebelled against the high gods and the system of the universe 
        fell into disorder': 'The planets altered their courses. The sky sank 
        lower towards the north. The sun, moon and stars changed their motions. 
        The earth fell to pieces and the waters in its bosom rushed upwards with 
        violence and overflowed the earth.'<FONT SIZE="-1">26</FONT></P>
      <P>In the Malaysian tropical forest the Gewong people believe that every 
        so often their own world, which they call <B>Earth Seven</B>, turns upside 
        down so that everything is flooded and destroyed. However, through the 
        agency of the Creator God <B>Tohan</B>, the flat new surface of what had 
        previously been the underside of <B>Earth</B> <B>Seven</B> is moulded 
        into mountains, valleys and plains. New trees are planted, and new humans 
        born.<FONT SIZE="-1">27..."</FONT></P>

        nation and as the founder of numerous towns and temples.<FONT SIZE="-1">38</FONT></P>
      <P>A similar figure was revered in <B>Vedic</B> India more than 3000 years 
        , ago. One day (the story goes)</P>
      <P>when a certain wise man named <B>Manu</B> was making his ablutions, he 
        found in the hollow of his hand a tiny lime fish which begged him to allow 
        it to live. Taking pity on it he put it in a jar. The next day, however, 
        it had grown so much bigger that he had to carry it to a lake.Soon the 
        lake was too small. 'Throw me into the sea,' said the fish &#91;which 
        was in reality a manifestation of the god <B>Vishnu</B>&#93; 'and I shall 
        be more comfortable.' Then he warned <B>Manu</B> of a coming deluge. He 
        sent him a large ship, with orders to load it with two of every living 
        species and the seeds of every plant, and then to go on board himnself.'<FONT SIZE="-1">39</FONT></P>
      <P><B>Manu</B> had only just carried out these orders when the ocean rose 
        and submerged everything, and nothing was to be seen but <B>Vishnu</B> 
        in his fish form - now a huge, one-horned creature with golden scales. 
        <B>Manu</B> moored his ark to the horn of the fish and <B>Vishnu</B> towed 
        it across the brimming waters until it came to rest on the exposed peak 
        of 'the Mountain of the North':<FONT SIZE="-1">40</FONT></P>
      <P>The fish said, 'I have saved thee; fasten the vessel to a tree, that 
        the water may not sweep it away while thou art on the mountain; and in 
        proportion as the waters decrease thou shalt descend.' <B>Manu</B> descended 
        with the waters. The Deluge had carried away all creatures and <B>Manu</B> 
        remained alone.<FONT SIZE="-1">41</FONT></P>
      <P>With him, and with the animals and plants he had saved from destruction, 
        began a new age of the world. After a year there emerged from the waters 
        a woman who announced herself as 'the daughter of <B>Manu'</B>. The couple 
        married and produced children, thus becoming the ancestors of the present 
        race of mankind.<FONT SIZE="-1">42</FONT></P>
      <P>Last but by no means least, Ancient Egyptian traditions also refer to 
        a great flood. A funerary text discovered in the tomb of <B>Pharaoh</B> 
        <B>Seti</B> I, for example, tells of the destruction of sinful humanity 
        by a deluge."3 The reasons for this catastrophe are set out in Chapter 
        CLXXV of the Book of the Dead, which attributes the following speech to 
        the <B>Moon God Thoth</B>:</P>
      <P>They have fought fights, they have upheld strifes, they have done evil, 
        / Page&nbsp;212 / they have created hostilities, they have made slaughter, 
        they have caused trouble and oppression. . . &#91;Therefore&#93; I am 
        going to blot out everything which I have made. This earth shall enter 
        into the watery abyss by means of a raging flood, and will become even 
        as it was in primeval time.<FONT SIZE="-1">44</FONT></P>
      <P><B>On the trail of a mystery</B></P>
      <P>With the words of <B>Thoth</B> we have come full circle to the Sumerian 
        and biblical floods. 'The earth was filled with violence', says Genesis:</P>
      <P>And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh 
        had corrupted his way upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, 1:5 'The 
        end of all flesh is corne before me; for the earth is filled with violence 
        through them; and behold I will destroy them with the earth.'<FONT SIZE="-1">45</FONT></P>
      <P>Like the flood of Deucalion, the flood of Manu, and the flood that destroyed 
        the Aztecs' 'Fourth Sun', the biblical deluge was the end of a world age.A 
        new age succeeded it: our own, populated by the descendants of Noah. From 
        the very beginning, however, it was understood that this age too would 
        in due course come to a catastrophic end. As the old song puts it, 'God 
        gave Noah the rainbow sign; no more water, the fire next time.'</P>
      <P>The Scriptural source for this prophecy of world destruction is to be 
        found in 2 Peter 3:</P>
      <P>We must be careful to remember that during the last days there are bound 
        to be people who will be scornful and &#91;who will say&#93;, 'Everything 
        goes on as it has since it began at the creation'.They are choosing to 
        forget that there were heavens at the beginning, and that the earth was 
        formed by the word of God out of water and between the waters,so that 
        the world of that time was destroyed by being flooded by water. But by 
        the same word, the present sky and earth are destined for ftre, and are 
        only being reserved until Judgement Day so that all sinners may be destroyed. 
        . . The Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, and then with 
        a roar the sky will vanish, the elements will catch fire and fall apart, 
        and the earth and all that it contains will be burnt up.<FONT SIZE="-1">46</FONT></P>
      <P>The Bible, therefore, envisages two ages of the world, our own being 
        / Page 213 / the second and last. Elsewhere, in other cultures, different 
        numbers of creations and destructions are recorded. In <B>China</B>, for 
        instance, the perished ages are called <I>kis</I>, ten of which are said 
        to have elapsed from the beginning of time until <B>Confucius</B>. At 
        the end of each <B><I>kis</I></B>, 'in a general convulsion of nature, 
        the sea is carried out of its bed, mountains spring up out of the ground, 
        rivers change their course, human beings and everything are ruined, and 
        the ancient traces effaced. . .'<FONT SIZE="-1">47 </FONT></P>
      <P>Buddhist scriptures speak of' <B>Seven Suns</B>', each brought to an 
        end by water, fire or wind.<FONT SIZE="-1">48</FONT> At the end of the 
        Seventh Sun, the current 'world cycle', it is expected that the 'earth 
        will break into flames'.<FONT SIZE="-1">49</FONT> Aboriginal traditions 
        of Sarawak and Sabah recall that the sky was once 'low' and tell us that 
        'six Suns perished. . . at present the world is illuminated by the seventh 
        Sun,.<FONT SIZE="-1">50</FONT> Similarly, the Sibylline Books speak of 
        'nine Suns that are nine ages' and prophesy two ages yet to come - those 
        of the eighth and the ninth Sun.,</P>
      <P>On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, the Hopi Indians of Arizona 
        (who are distant relatives of the Aztecss2) record three previous Suns, 
        each culminating in a great annihilation followed by the gradual re-emergence 
        of mankind. In Aztec cosmology, of course, there were four Suns prior 
        to our own. Such minor differences concerning the precise number of destructions 
        and creations envis-aged in this or that mythology should not distract 
        us from the remarkable convergence of ancient traditions evident here. 
        Allover the world these traditions appear to commemmorate a widespread 
        series of catastrophes. In many cases the character of each successive 
        cataclysm is obscured by the use of poetic language and the piling up 
        of metaphor and symbols. Quite frequently, also, at least two different 
        kinds of disaster may be portrayed as having occurred simultaneously (most 
        frequently floods and earthquakes, but sometimes fire and a terrifying 
        darkness).</P>
      <P>All this contributes to the creation of a confused and jumbled picture. 
        The myths of the Hopi, however, stand out for their straightforwardness 
        and simplicity. What they tell us is this:</P>
      <P>The first world was destroyed, as a punishment for human rnisde- meanours, 
        by an all-consuming fire that came from above and below. The second world 
        ended when the terrestrial globe toppled from its axis / Page 214 / and 
        everything was covered with ice. The third world ended in a universal 
        flood. The present world is the fourth. Its fate will depend on whether 
        or not its inhabitants behave in accordance with the Creator's plans.<FONT SIZE="-1">53</FONT></P>
      <P>We are on the trail of a mystery here. And while we may never hope to 
        fathom the plans of the Creator we should be able to reach a judgement 
        concerning the riddle of our converging myths of global destrqction.</P>
      <P>Through these myths the voices of the ancients speak to us directly. 
        What are they trying to say? "</P>

      <P>"There was the thread, the thread you see, and she followed it. Curdie, 
        no that was a boy, Curdie and the thread, the good boy, he got her through. 
        Or there was a fall of rock and it was buried, she had to scrabble with 
        her hands and they never got them out those people trapped underneath 
        when the earthquake collapsed the buildings. I can remember the man with 
        his bare hands, they were bare, raw, that's it, skinned - but it must 
        have been a pic-ture of course.</P>
      <P>But the thread was there, sometimes - he was losing it, losing his thought.</P>
      <P>Yes, that was the way the thread went, it came and went, elu-sive as 
        thought - now it flashed into focus, now he had it, him sitting reading 
        to his little girl - but he can't have had that book as a child, he hadn't 
        had that sort of childhood.</P>
      <P>Thinking about the thread, the idea, myth of the thread was a good way 
        to get you applying yourself, persisting, and he had, hadn't he, he'd 
        gone on searching with his dog in the rubble long after the others had 
        given up.</P>
      <P>So that thinking, which he'd thought he'd come to as a solid thing like 
        chipping away shale and muck to get at a bit of core, a thing like a lump 
        of coal, usable, source of energy, so that it didn't matter what you thought, 
        it was a rope ladder to get you across somewhere, get you through the 
        mess, something you pretended, no, not pretended - made up? - to be doing 
        to give a reason for going on. Made up. Ah perhaps something you made, 
        engineered, he'd like it when they called him Monsieur l'lngenieur, ingenious. 
        Not for a reason - you don't need a reason for going on, you need a road, 
        a way, ah yes a means. A way of going. That was tautology. You could just 
        say 'a way'.</P>
      <P>'Tell Alice' (you think I don't know she's dead, he heard his crafty 
        thought within his head and in the same flash behaved as if he didn't), 
        'keep her fingers on the golden thread.' If it's all a fancy, if there 
        isn't something that's true, then there isn't untrue and you were back 
        where you were. He was getting there, getting down that path and this 
        time he would get there, he could still breathe he could still tell them 
        even though they couldn't move the rock off him.</P>
      <P>If there isn't anything that's true, the opposite of true was false. 
        But it couldn't be false because you can't have an opposite to some- thing 
        that doesn't exist. Though what about negative numbers? / Page 168 / Alice 
        was cleverer than he was he should have asked her. But she could never 
        explain things like he could but after all he'd been a teacher. So if 
        no true, no false and nothing true means everything false. Yes, he'd got 
        it. 'Useful,' he said. They bent low pretending they could hear to encourage 
        him to speak some more. Useful. It was all useful. Alice's knitting had 
        been useful. The thread and the rope ladder and the bridge were useful.

        truth' because he knew they thought he thought truth was the pearl so 
        he had it both ways. They would have been his next, last words but he 
        kept his secret from them till the end because he had got beyond the division 
        of time that living beings need in order to negotiate it, to a point where 
        command question statement implying continuing into a future from the 
        past were neither true, false or useful."</P>

      <P>"LONG days - the longest, objectively speaking, and with reference to 
        the hours of daylight they contained; since their astronomical length 
        could not affect the swift passage of them, either taken singly or in 
        their monotonous general flow. The vernal equinox lay three months back, 
        the solstice was at hand. But the seasons up here / Page 368 / followed 
        the calendar with halting steps, and only within the last few days had 
        spring fairly arrived: a spring still without hint of summer's denser 
        air, rarefied, ethereal, and balmy, with the sun sending silvery gleams 
        from a blue heaven, and the meadows blithe with parti-coloured flowers.</P>
      <P>Hans Castorp found bluebells and yarrow on the hill-side, like the ones 
        Joachim had put in his room to greet him when he came;and seeing them, 
        realized how the year was rounding out. Those others had been the late 
        blossoms of the declining summer; whereas now the tender emerald grass 
        of the sloping meadows was thick- starred with every sort of bloom, cup-shaped, 
        bell-shaped, star- shaped, any-shaped, filling the sunny air with warm 
        spice and scent: quantities of wild pansies and fly-bane, daisies, red 
        and yel-low primulas, larger and finer than any Hans Castorp had ever 
        seen down below, so far as he could recall noticing, and the nodding soldanella, 
        peculiar to the region, with its little eye-lashed bells of rose-colour, 
        purple, and blue.</P>
      <P>Hans Castorp gathered a bunch of all this loveliness and took it to his 
        room; by no means with the idea of decoration, but of set and serious 
        scientific intent. He had assembled an apparatus to serve his need: a 
        botanical text-book, a handy little trowel to take up roots, a herbarium, 
        a powerful pocket-lens. The young man set to work in his loggia., clad 
        in one of the light summer suits he had brought up with him when he came 
        - another sign that his first year was rounding out its course.</P>
      <P>Fresh-cut flowers stood about in glasses within his room, and on the 
        lamp-stand beside his highly superior chair. Flowers half faded, wilted 
        but not dry, lay scattered on the floor of the loggia and on the balustrade; 
        others, between sheets of blotting-paper, were giving out their moisture 
        under pressure from heavy stones. When they were quite dry and flat, he 
        would stick them with strips of paper into his album. He lay with his 
        knees up, one crossed over the other, the manual open face down upon his 
        chest like a little gabled roof; holding the thick bevelled lens between 
        his honest blue eyes and a blossom in his other hand, from which he had 
        cut away with his pocket-knife a pan of the corolla, in order the better 
        to examine the thalamus - what a great fleshy lump it looked through the 
        powerful lens! The anthers shook out their yellow pollen on the thalamus 
        from the tips of their filaments, the pitted pistil stood stiffly up from 
        the ovaries; when Hans Castorp cut throug it lon-gitudinally, he could 
        see the narrow channel through which the pollen grains and utricles were 
        floated by the nectar secretion into the ovarian cavity. Hans Castorp 
        counted, tested, compared; he / Page 369 / studied the structure and grouping 
        of calyx and petals as well as the maJe and female organs; compared what 
        he found with the sketches and diagrams in his book; and saw with satisfaction 
        that these were accurate when tested by the structure of such plants as 
        were known to him. Then he went on to those he had not known the names 
        of, and by the help of his Linnaeus established their class group, order, 
        species, family, and genus. As he had time at his dis-posal; he actually 
        made some progress in botanical systematization on the basis of comparative 
        morphology. Beneath each dried speci- men in his herbarium he carefully 
        inscribed in ornamental lettering the Latin name which a humanistic science 
        had gaJlantly bestowed on it; added its distinguishing characteristics, 
        and submitted the whole to the approvaJ of the good Joachim. who was all 
        admiration.</P>
      <P>Evenings he gazed at the stars. He was seized with an interest in the 
        passing year - he who had already spent some twenty-odd cycles upon this 
        earth without ever troubling his head about it. If the writer has been 
        driven to taJk about the vernaJ equinox and suchlike, it is because these 
        terms formed the present mental furni-ture of our hero, which he now loved 
        to set out on all occasions, here too surprising his cousin by the fund 
        of information at his command.</P>
      <P>" The sun," he might begin, as they took their walks together, " will 
        soon be entering the sign of the Crab. Do you know what that means? It 
        is the first summer sign of the zodiac, you know. Then come Leo and Virgo, 
        and then the autumn, the equinox, toward the end of September, when the 
        rays of me sun fall ver-tically upon the equator again, as they did in 
        March, when the sun was in the sign of the Ram."</P>
      <P>" I regret to say it escaped my attention," Joachim said grumpily, What 
        is all that you are reeling off so glibly about the Ram and the zodiac? 
        "</P>
      <P>" Why, you know what the zodiac is - the primitive heavenly signs: Scorpio, 
        Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and the rest. How can you help being 
        interested in them? At least, you must know there are twelve of them, 
        three for each season, the ascending and the declining year, the circle 
        of constellations through which the sun passes. I think it's great. Imagine, 
        they have been found em-ployed as ceiling decoration in an Egyptian temple 
        - and a temple of Aphrodite, to boot - not far from Thebes. They were 
        known to the Chaldeans too, the Chaldeans, if you please, those Arabic-Semitic 
        old necromancers, who were so well versed in astrology and soothsaying. 
        They knew and studied the zone in the heavens through which the planets 
        revolve; and they divided it into twelve / Page 370 / signs by constellations, 
        the <I>dodecatemoria</I>, just as they have been handed down to us. Magnificent, 
        isn't it? There's humanity for you! "</P>
      <P>" You talk about humanity just like Settembrini."</P>
      <P>" Yes - and yet not just the same either. You have to take hu-manity 
        as it is; but even so I find it magnificent. I like to think about the 
        Chaldeans when I lie and look at the planets they were familiar with - 
        for, clever as they were, they did not know them all. But the ones they 
        did not know I cannot see either. Uranus was only re-cently discovered, 
        by means of the telescope - a hundred and twenty years ago."</P>
      <P>" You call that recently? "</P>
      <P>" I call it recently - with your kind permission - in comparison with 
        the three thousand years since their time. But when I lie and look at 
        the panets, even the three thousand years get to seem 'recently,' and 
        I begin to think quite intimately of the Chaldeans, and how in their time 
        they gazed at the stars and made verses on them - and all that is humanity 
        too."</P>
      <P>" I must say, you have very tall ideas in your head."</P>
      <P>" You call them tall, and I call them intimate - it's all the same, whatever 
        you like to call it. But when the sun enters Libra again, in about three 
        months from now, the days will have shortened so much that day and night 
        will be equal. The days keep on getting shorter until about Christmas-time, 
        as you know. But now you must please bear in mind that, while the sun 
        goes through the win-ter signs - Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces - the 
        days are already getting longer! For then spring is on the way again - 
        the three-thousandth spring since the Chaldeans; and the days go on length-ening 
        until we have come round the year, and summer begins again."</P>
      <P>" Of course."</P>
      <P>" No, not of course at all- it is really all hocus-pocus. The days lengthen 
        in the winter-time, and when the longest comes, the twenty-first of June, 
        the beginning of summer, they begin to go downhill again, toward winter. 
        You call that' of course '; but if one once loses hold of the fact that 
        it is of course, it is quite fright-ening, you feel like hanging on to 
        something. It seems like a prac-tical joke - that spring begins at the 
        beginning of winter, and autumn at the beginning of summer. You feel you're 
        being fooled, led about in a circle, with your eye fixed on something 
        that turns out to be a moving point. A moving point in a circle. For the 
        circle consists of nothing but such transitional points without any extent 
        whatever; the curvature is incommensurable, there is no duration / Page 
        371 / of motion, and eternity turns out to be not' straight ahead' but 
        ' merry-go-round '! "</P>
      <P>For goodness' sake, stop! "</P>
      <P>" The feast of the solstice - midsummer night! Fires on the mountain-top, 
        and ring-around-a-rosy about the leaping flames! I have never seen it; 
        but they say our rude forefathers used thus to celebrate the first summer 
        night, the night with which autumn be-gins, the very midday and zenith 
        of the year, the point from which It goes downhill again: they danced 
        and whirled and shouted and exulted - and why, really, all that primitive 
        exultation? Can you make it out? What were they so joIly about? Was it 
        because from then on the world went down into the dark - or perhaps because 
        it had up till then gone uphill, and now the turning-point was reached, 
        the fleeting moment of midsummer night and midsummer madness, the meeting-place 
        of tears and laughter? I express it as it is, ill the words that come 
        to me. Tragic joy, triumphant sadness - that was what made our ancestors 
        leap and exuft around the leaping flames: they did so as an act of homage 
        to the madness of the circle, to an eternity without duration, in which 
        everything recurs - ..."&nbsp;</P>

      <P>"The 'solar way' or 'path of Horus' is, of course, the ecliptic - that 
        imaginary way or path in the sky on which the sun appears to travel through 
        the twelve signs of the zodiac. As we saw in earlier chapters, the direction 
        of the sun's 'journey' during the course of the solar year is Aquarius 
        -:; Pisces -:; Aries -:; Taurus -:; Gemini -:; Cancer -:; Leo, etc., etc. 
        The reader will recall, however, that there is also another, more ponderous 
        motion, the precession of the earth's axis, which gradually rotates the 
        'ruling' constellation against the background of which the sun is seen 
        to rise at dawn on the vernal equinox. This great cycle, or 'Great Year', 
        takes 25,920 solar years to complete, with the vernal point spending 2,160 
        years in each of the twelve zodiacal constellations. The direction of 
        motion is Leo -:; Cancer -:; Gemini -:; Taurus -:; Aries -:; Pisces -:; 
        Aquarius, etc., etc., i.e. the reverse of the route pursued by the sun 
        during the course of the solar year.</P>

      <P>In addition to the Turin Papyrus other chronological records support 
        the notion of an immensely ancient 'academy' at work behind the scenes 
        in Egypt. Amongst these, the most influential were compiled, / &nbsp;Page 
        224 / as we saw earlier, by Manetho (literally, 'Truth of Thoth'), who 
        lived in the third century BC and who 'rose to be high priest in the temple 
        at Heliopolis'.<FONT SIZE="-1">17</FONT> There he wrote his now lost History 
        of Egypt which later commentators tell us was divided up into three volumes 
        dealing, respectively, with 'the Gods, the Demigods, the Spirits of the 
        Dead and the mortal Kings who ruled Egypt'. <FONT SIZE="-1">18</FONT></P>
      <P>The 'Gods' it seems, ruled for 13,900 years. After them 'the Demigods 
        and Spirits of the Dead' - epithets for the 'Followers of Horus' - ruled 
        for a further 11,025 years.<FONT SIZE="-1">19</FONT> Then began the reign 
        of the mortal kings, which Manetho divided into the thirty-one dynasties 
        still used and accepted by scholars today.</P>
      <P>Other fragments from Manetho's <I>History </I>also suggest that important 
        and powerful beings were present in Egypt long before the dawn of its 
        historical period under the rule of Menes. For example Fragment 3, preserved 
        in the works of George Syncellus, speaks of 'six dynasties or six gods 
        who. . . reigned for 1 1,985 years,.<FONT SIZE="-1">20</FONT> And in a 
        number of sources Manetho is said to have given the figure of 36,525 years 
        for the entire duration of the civilization of Egypt from the time of 
        the gods down to the end of the last dynasty of mortal kings.<FONT SIZE="-1">21</FONT></P>
      <P>A rather different total of around 23,000 years has been handed down 
        to us by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus who visited ~ Egypt in the 
        first century DC and spoke there with priests and ~ chroniclers. According 
        to the stories he was told: 'At first Gods and if Heroes ruled Egypt for 
        a little less than 18,000 years. . . Mortals have' been kings of their 
        country, they say, for a little less than 5000 years.' <FONT SIZE="-1">22</FONT></P>

        you forget about the colours at all, then there is a lesser rotaton by 
        which you could move a dark triangle into the space of the light triangle 
        beside it because it is identical in shape. This operation of rotation 
        then goes on into the dark, into the light, into the dark, into the light, 
        and finally back into the original dark triangle - a sixfold symmetry 
        of space which rotates the whole pattern. And the sixfold symmetry in 
        fact is the one we all know best, because it is a symmetry of the snow 
        crystal.</P>

        which is hard to remember, and that is that we live in a special kind 
        of space - three-dimensional, flat - and the properties of that space

        we are discovering the invisible laws that govern our space. There are

      <P>"As has been pointed out it would seem that Christ himself expected little 
        of the crowds who gathered to hear him and witnessed his miracles. He 
        talked to them only in parables the meaning, of which he expounded to 
        his disciples after the crowds had dispersed.</P>
      <P>Therefore I speak to them in parables: because they seeing, see not; 
        and hearing, they hear not, neither do they understand. And in them is 
        fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias which saith, By hearing ye shall hear 
        and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive; 
        or this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, 
        and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with 
        their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their 
        hearts, and should be converted, / Page 220 / and I should heal them but 
        blessed are in your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</P>
      <P>The words 'Who hath ears to hear, let him hear', resounded through the 
        gospels. In one form or another they are repeated <B>nine</B> times in 
        the Synoptic gospels and <B>eight</B> times in Revelation.</P>

      <P>Take a beautiful cube of pyrites. .Or to me .the most exquisite crystal 
        of all, fluorite, an octahedron. (It is also the natural shape{the diamond 
        crystal.) Their symmetries are imposed on them / Page 174 / by the nature 
        of the space we live in - the three dimensions, the flatness within which 
        we live. And no assembly of atoms can break that crucial law of nature. 
        Like the: units that compose a pattern, the atoms in a crystal are stacked 
        in all directions. So a crystal, like a pattern, must have a shape that 
        could extend or repeat itself in all directions indefinitely. That is 
        why the faces of a crystal can only have certain shapes; they could not 
        have any- thing but the symmetries in the patterns. For example, the only 
        rotations that are possible go twice or four times for a full turn, or 
        three times or six times - not more. And not five times. You cannot make 
        an assembly of atoms to make triangles which fit into space regularly 
        five at a time.</P>
      <P>Thinking about these forms of pattern, exhausting in practice the possibilities 
        of the symmetries of space (at least in two dimensions), was the great 
        achievement of Arab mathematics. And it has a wonderful finality, a thousand 
        years old. The king, the naked women, the eunuchs and the blind musicians 
        made a marvellous formal pattern in which the exploration of what exists 
        was perfect, but which, alas, was not lqoking for any change. There is 
        nothing new in mathematics, because there is nothing new in human thought, 
        until the ascent of man moved forward to a different dynamic."</P>
